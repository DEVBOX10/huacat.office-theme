#### Way 1:

- Launch Paint 3D and paste Screenshot.
- Use color picker to get MS Office color.

#### Way 2:
- Download [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases) and Install it.
- Use `Win + Shift + c` to use color picker.
- You can pick colors without `PrtScn`! (If the color is a small part in Office, you can use `PrtScn` instead.)
